# Advent Of Code 2023

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023), written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Installation

Follow the [instructions here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) to install Rust and Cargo.

## Usage

Each problem is separated by the folder denoted by the day order (e.g. day01). Since each problem is structured as a standalone without having any dependencies, in order to run, go to the desired problem's directory and run with cargo as follows.

```
cd day01

cargo run PART_NUMBER # part 1 or 2

# or run with the actual test file
cargo run PART_NUMBER test.input
```

## Testing

There are unit tests, to run these:

```
cargo test
```
